## About

This portfolio website is a representation of my journey, skills, and accomplishments as a [your profession]. It provides an overview of my expertise, showcases my projects, and provides a glimpse into my creative endeavors. It also serves as a medium to connect with like-minded individuals and collaborate on interesting projects.
A static website is delivered to a user exactly the way it‚Äôs stored. That means that nothing on the page will change by the user or even the site administrator unless there‚Äôs a redesign of the site, or the site administrator goes directly into the code to change it.  
A static site is the most basic kind of website, and the easiest to create. It requires no server-side (also called back-end) processing, only client-side. Client-side technologies are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
No programming languages, including JavaScript, are required to make a static site. However, if a site utilizes JavaScript, but no PHP or any other programming language, it‚Äôs still considered a static site (since JavaScript is a client-side language).
Dynamic site examples include:
   - ** E-commerce sites
   - ** Blogs
   - ** Calendars, or to-do sites
   - ** Any site with information that must be updated regularly
